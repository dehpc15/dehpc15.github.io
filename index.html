                <p>The development of High-performance Computing codes is a difficult, low-productivity task because of the complexity and fast evolution of the target platforms, the importance of achieving optimal performance, and the need to ensure that applications are portable so that the investment in software development can be amortized over multiple generations of hardware. This problem will worsen as we approach exascale because of increased architectural complexity (e.g. by the use of multiple acceleration technologies), and the need to handle issues specific to these systems, such as ensuring that applications are power aware, or that must be cognizant of resilience issues. In addition to the architectural issues, scientific codes can often entail significant software engineering challenges. For example, they may be developed by multiple independent teams, each of whom may be focussing on a different component of the application, but must also be able to work closely together in order to achieve a high degree of code optimization. In addition, the application itself may comprise a number of loosely coupled modules that are required to operate in a complex workflow in order to generate valid results.</p>
                <p>An additional challenge is resulting from a diversification of methods, languages and tools used in a rapidly growing class of data analytics problems, which are being supported in the next generation of NSF-funded &quot;innovative computing&quot; systems designed to support analytics workloads (using tools such as R, Hadoop and Spark, and languages such Python).  These environments are designed to support interactive use, elastic use (through cloud technologies), virtualization including virtual cluster support, and both static and dynamic database provisioning of a diverse number of databases.  These problems and resources pose questions related to appropriate environments to develop software and support problem execution, including the need to support interactivity where appropriate.</p>
                <p>A significant barrier to higher productivity is the lack of high quality software development environments that target HPC and the development models employed by HPC codes. This is especially the case across a diverse range of HPC platforms. This workshop intends to bring together code developers, tool developers, and users of HPC software development environments in order to foster a community effort to address these obstacles.</p>

                <p>High-Performance Computing platforms are increasingly challenging to program. The hardware is becoming more complex because of a large number of concurrent threads per node, heterogeneous cores, deep memory hierarchies, increased variability in computation and communication time and the need to reduce energy consumption and handle frequent faults. The software is becoming more complex as it combines codes developed by independent teams using different programming languages, and combines simulation with data analysis. The need for top performance and the need for portability are conflicting forces that are hard to reconcile.</p>
                <p>The HPC community also suffers from a lack of good development environments that can be used across platforms, and handle well the unique problems of coding for HPC. This lack reduces the productivity of HPC programmers.</p>
                <p>The workshop will focus on research that aims at solving these problems and advance the state of the art in HPC Software Development Environments.</p>
                <p>Topic of interest include, but are not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Integrated development environments for parallel computing and HPC</li>
                    <li>Refactorings for performance and portability of parallel code</li>
                    <li>Case studies on the adoption and use of IDEs for parallel computing and HPC</li>
                    <li>Software development environments for GPUs and accelerators</li>
                    <li>Software development environment support for emerging parallel programming models and environments</li>
                    <li>Software development environment support for scientific domain specific languages</li>
